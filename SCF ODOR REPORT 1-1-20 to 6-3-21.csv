What is the city of Portland *doing* to protect its tax-payers from the carcinogenic fumes coming from Sprague Energy LP? Before July 21, 2015, Sprague had not obtained a license from ME DEP required in order to emit VOCs in connection with the storage and distribution of No. 6 oil and asphalt at the South Portland Facility. Not only did the EPA investigation uncover that Sprague’s toxic fumes had exceeded VOC emissions limits, they also revealed that Sprague (""Global Partners LLC"") didn't even have a license to legally own and operate their tanks. Sprague is poisoning the air we breathe, endangering public health, destroying the ozone, not paying their taxes, and they don't even have a license to operate. Of interest to the general public being quietly poisoned by Sprague’s criminal operations, Sprague (SRLP) reported revenue of $3.5 BILLION in 2019. 
Sprague has committed these egregious violations all over New England. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) forced Sprague to install equipment to control odors emanating from three heated bulk storage tanks located at the facility that currently store liquid asphalt and #6 oil and/or other heavy petroleum products. This equipment includes a carbon bed and mist eliminator to absorb odors and protect public health. Why isn’t Portland mandating the same thing? Why does this company get so many free passes?
The smell is dizzying, and it easily penetrates brick walls, closed windows with storms, and 5""-thick doors. Sitting in my living room, surrounded by sealed doors and windows, it smells like I’m lounging on a pool float *inside* of an oil tank. We know that entire families are becoming ill and dying because of these fumes -- both in the West End and in South Portland. My neighbors are dying of lung disease and cancer at increasingly alarming rates, despite never smoking a single cigarette in their lives. Coincidence? I’m sure you can answer that.

The EPA fined Sprague with a tiny fraction of their annual profit - nothing more than a gentle tap on the wrist - to placate the distractible general public. 
Portland is my home, and I love this city, but we’re going to lose the majority of our tax base if our elected officials don't step up and demand clean air as a basic human right. I don’t pay $20,000 per year in taxes to breathe carcinogenic fumes that destroy our neurotransmitters and give my babies cancer, while padding the pockets of Big Oil. We’ve devoted months of our city council’s time to discussing marijuana sales, while the air we breathe is being quietly poisoned by a company who doesn’t care about Maine or Portland residents. It's about time the city actually did something, instead of expecting the EPA to care. The EPA officials don’t care about Portland, they’re on vacation in St. Barths for the next six months. I would appreciate a legitimate response to my original question: what is the city of Portland *doing* to protect its citizens?
